# Spelling Bee

Spelling Bee is an online Quiz game that aims at building users vocabulary in order to improve their ability to spell English words.  Users will learn a lot through play since it is a fun game that cuts across all ages, which means that it can be played and enjoyed by all to test how much of their vocabulary they know and if they can spell the words and write them down correctly in order to make a complete sentence. Sometimes, even simple words in English language that we pronounce and use everyday can throw someone off balance when it comes to spelling and writing them down correctly especially for CV and cover letter preparation, formal letter or any where that first impression matters and one's spelling has to be top-notch to prevent your CV from being shoved aside by potential employers due to poor spelling mistakes.

# Features

It is designed to be responsive on all device sizes and thereby accessible on a range of devices. Usability was thought of from the start so the user interface was designed in its simplest form with good colour contrast between the background and text colours respectively. The font-size and weight of the texts are large and bold with all texts aligned to the centre so that it can be easily tweaked/adjusted to fit different screen sizes using the "@media screen css rule".  Also, the buttons for navigating around and for submission are big enough to see.  All these features will ensure that both first time and returning users/visitors to the site find it easy to read the texts, navigate around the interface pretty quickly, interact with the game and have a pleasurable experience while doing so. 

## Existing Features

* Heading Bar

    * It is uniform across all the three pages and consists of the logo and Spelling Bee quiz name nicely placed beside each other and aligned to the centre to keep in line with the overall structure of the page.

    * See the 'Heading Bar' Screenshot below:

    <img src="assets/images/.JPG">

 &nbsp; 

    The entire user interface is divided into three parts namely:

      i. Home Page

      ii. Quiz Page

      iii. End Page (Score Display Area) 


* Home Page 

    * This is the page that appears as a user clicks on the url link and lands on the page. It is defined from the rest the of the screen page by a black border with a heading bar at the top. It welcomes the user and aims at making them feel relaxed and tune them in to a playful fun mode while at the same time learning through their interaction with the quiz app. It consists of two buttons located at the top centre of the page which are the 'play' (the user clicks this to play the quiz) and 'high score' (the user clicks this and it displays thir score) buttons and also a welcome message nicely positioned at the centre of the page.
    For mobile view, most of these features on this page will stack on top of each other for great user experience and responsiveness.

&nbsp; 

* Quiz Page

    * This is the page that the user interacts with in orer to play the quiz. Like the home page, it is defined from the rest the of the screen page by a black border with a heading bar at the top in order to keep in line with uniformity across all  three pages. It consists of 10 questions with each having four options to choose their answer from. Each of the options are displayed inside a button with a default background colour of blue. If a user gets the answer right, the button colour changes to green and a "pat-in-the-back" message pops up to congratulate and spur them to do more and if a user misses the answer, the button colour changes to red and a message pops up to tell them they missed and tell them they can do better.
    A user's score is displayed at the top right hand corner of the page while question number tracker is displayed at the top left corner of the page to let the user know which question they are on.
    The feedback message pops up underneath the score and question tracker area and is nicely centred so it can be clearly seen by the user as they play along.
    For mobile view, most of these features on this page will stack on top of each other for great user experience and responsiveness.

    * See the 'Quiz Page' Screenshot below:

    <img src="assets/images/.JPG">

 &nbsp; 

* End Page (Score Display Area)       

    * This is the page that the user is directed to at the end of the quiz game. Like the other pages, it is defined from the rest the of the screen page by a black border with a heading bar at the top in order to keep in line with the uniformity already established with other pages. The overall score is displayed at the top centre of the page and a text input box is also provided to allow the user fill in their names for onward use. 
    Finally, the "Back to Home Page" button is displayed at the bottom of the page that redirects the user back to the home page if they wish to play again.
    For mobile view, most of these features on this page will stack on top of each other for great user experience and responsiveness.
    
    * See the 'End Page' Screenshot below:

    <img src="assets/images/.JPG">

 &nbsp; 

How the Quiz Game works (Use Cases):

 It is a multiple choice question whereby a set of ten questions are provided to the user one after the other in which each is an uncomplete sentence and the job of the user is to fill in each of the blank spaces with the correct word (answer), checking out the options provided carefully before selecting their choice as they look the same to trick the user into picking the wrong answer.  It informs the user at the bottom of the Quiz screen the number of questions he got right and the ones missed by updating its content as the user goes through the ten questions.
 At the end of the quiz, it gives a final verdict in the following way:

 a. If a user scores between 7 and 10 inclusive, it congratulates him by displaying an alert that says "Congratulations ${username}, that was  fantastic!" ( ${username} is a placeholder for the system to fill in each user's name).  
 b. If a user scores between 4 and 6 inclusive, it tells the user he's tried by displaying an alert that says "Well-done ${username} but there is room for improvement!".  
 c. If a user scores between 0 and 3 inclusive, it tells the user he's failed by displaying an alert that says "Oops you failed ${username}, please try again!".

User Experience (UX)

* User stories

    * First Time Visitor Goals

        a) I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and navigate easily around it.
        very intuitive and easy to figure out how to

        b) I want to be able to submit my answer and get response quickly on whether I'm right or wrong.

        c) I want to be able to know how many I got right and the ones I missed with the correct answer displayed.

        
    * Returning Visitor Goals

        a) I want to be able to find relevant information about the opening hours, entry fee etc. to see if there are any changes.

        b) I want to find the best way to get in contact with the tourist centre with any questions or feedbacks I may have.

        c) I want to be able to connect to their social media links to provide feedback and get up to date information about upcoming events.

    * Design

        * Colour Scheme

            * Background colour of a lighter shade of purple was used with a black border. It blends well into the font colour of black which is predominantly used for texts on every page and grey background colour for the buttons.

        *  Typography

            * Google's 'Raleway' and 'Nova Square' typeface was repeatedly used on every page of this website but with variations in sizes and font weights. Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif and it is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. The source is: url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lora&display=swap'). This font is one of the most common and frequently used web safe fonts in HTML and most browsers recognise it.


        * Imagery

            * Imagery is important. The large image of the Olumo Rock is used to capture the users imagination and attract them to visit the tourist centre.  It is designed to take up almost the full width of the 'Home' Page to make it striking and catch the user's attention.  Also, the Gallery Page consists of a wide range of pictures for users to view and be inspired for a visit and also enjoy.

# Wireframes

 For prototyping, the wireframes were designed manually by hand without using any automated tool in order to bring this idea to life. The screenshots of all the three pages the quiz will have namely home, quiz and end pages   and its look on mobile devices can be viewed below:

    The Query/Feedback section is an HTML form that allow users to send their queries and/or give feedbacks so that the website owner can use this information to further improve on the services being provided. 
    At the moment, when a user fills the form and hits the submit button, there's no system in place at the backend to process the data submitted by the user so since there is no implementation for that yet and to forestall the system from throwing a 405 error, the form was made to reset itself instead. It is hoped that the backend will be implemented in the near  future.
